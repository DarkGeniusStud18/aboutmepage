        <p>My name is Byron ADJ, a first year undergraduate student in Computer Systems and Software. My interest in IT began with my curiosity for technology and the desire to understand how digital tools transform our daily lives.</p>

        <p>Today, I mean currently, I'm learning about web development and practising what I've learned with technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript and some frameworks like React,Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, while discovering the basics of programming and algorithms. Through this portfolio, I share my first projects, witnesses of my learning and my passion for development.</p>
        
        <p>My ambition is to master more languages â€‹and frameworks, to contribute to innovative projects, and to explore areas such as artificial intelligence or software development. Outside of my studies, in my free time, I like playing basketball, reading technical articles and listening to music.</p>
        
        <p>I am open to collaborations and always ready to learn new things to advance my professional journey.</p>
